Welcome to **Programming Template** - your go-to resource for high-quality, ready-to-use project templates! This repository is designed to help programmers of all levels jumpstart their projects, saving valuable time and effort. Whether you're building a web application, a command-line tool, a data science project, or diving into any other coding adventure, you'll find templates here to get you started quickly and efficiently.

## Why Use Programming Templates?

Starting a project from scratch can be a daunting task. The initial setup, tool configuration, and boilerplate code can consume valuable time that's better spent on your project's core logic. Templates provide a pre-configured foundation, allowing you to:

**Benefits of Using Programming Templates:**

*   **üöÄ Save Time:** Skip the tedious setup and jump straight into the heart of your project.
*   **üí° Best Practices:** Benefit from industry-standard project structures, coding styles, and tooling.
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Reduce Errors:** Minimize common setup mistakes and configuration issues.
*   **üìö Faster Learning:** Explore diverse project types and understand their structural nuances.
*   **üîÑ Consistency:** Maintain uniformity and coherence across your projects.

## Templates Included

This repository currently hosts a variety of templates, including:

### Python

*   **[`python-package`](python/python_package_template):** A comprehensive template for building distributable Python packages.
    *   Ready for PyPI publication.
    *   Includes a well-configured `pyproject.toml`.
    *   Pre-setup with testing (`pytest`), linting (`flake8`), formatting (`black`, `isort`).

**(More templates are actively being developed! See our TODO list below.)**


**Contribution Guidelines:**

*   **Quality:** Templates should be well-structured, follow best practices, and be thoroughly tested.
*   **Documentation:** Each template **must** have a `README.md` explaining its usage, including any necessary setup steps.
*   **Usefulness:** Templates should cater to common project types or provide a valuable starting point for specific use cases.
*   **Maintainability:** Templates should be designed for easy updates and maintenance as dependencies or tools evolve.

## TODO List

We have big plans for expanding and improving this repository! Here's a glimpse of what's on our roadmap:

### Template Expansion:

#### Python

*   [ ] **`python-basic`:** A basic Python project template with `setup.py`, `README.md`, and a simple example module.
